## Hey. 👋
My name is Jan, and I'm mainly a backend developer in Java, sometimes working with JavaScript and TypeScript as well.

Right now, I'm working on [discord.jar](https://github.com/discord-jar/discord.jar) and [Placard](https://github.com/placardapp/placard).

Other than that, I'm also a musician who plays keys.
