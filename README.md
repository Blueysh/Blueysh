### Hey. üëã
My name is **Jan**, and I'm mainly a backend developer in Java with 3+ years of experience. I do a bit of work with JavaScript and TypeScript as well.

Right now, I'm working at [**Candor Studios**](https://discord.gg/candorstudios) as a freelance developer, providing Minecraft Plugin Development and Discord Bot Development.

### I've got experience with...
- **Java**: 3+ years
- **Minecraft Development (Java)**: 3+ years
- **Discord API**: 1 year
- **JavaScript / TypeScript**: 1 year
- **Python**: Less than 1 year

### I've contributed to...
- The [**discord.jar project**](https://github.com/discord-jar/discord.jar)
- The [**Skyscape project**](https://github.com/Skyscape-SP)
- Other private projects

Other than that, I'm also a musician who plays keys, and I love music (though that's probably a given)!

### Come say hi!
